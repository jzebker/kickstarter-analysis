## Overview of Project
Using the Kickstarter data set, create 2 technical analyses deliverables on fundraising campaign outcomes for the categories given, one based on their launch dates and one based on their funding goals.  In addition, submit a written analysis of the results.
### Purpose
Provide Louise with insight and analysis on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Create a pivot table in Excel of campaign outcomes vs their launch date. Filter by the parent category "theater" and by year of launch date.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
